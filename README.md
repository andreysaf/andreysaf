### Head of Product Engineering & AI Product Engineer

I’m not just an AI PM who vibe codes prototypes — I ship real software.
With a strong software engineering background, I can assess AI output for correctness, quality, and real-world usability. I lead and build across B2C, B2B SaaS, and developer tools, operating comfortably from strategy to code.
